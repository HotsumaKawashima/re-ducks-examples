# Re-ducks Todos with Flow Example
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and is a translation of the [Redux Todos Flow example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos-flow) using the re-ducks modular approach.

## Translation changes to note
**tldr; watch your state shape!**

Since the ducks and re-ducks approaches use the combineReducer Redux method more the state shape changes from the original Redux Todos example.

### Redux Todos
```js
state {
  todos: [],
  visibilityFilter: "SHOW_ALL"
}
```
### Ducks/Re-ducks Todos
```js
state {
  todosState {
    todos: [],
    visibilityFilter: "SHOW_ALL"
  }
}
```

This is due to the fact that `/src/state/ducks/index.js` exports all the reducers from the feature folders. This is where the name of each feature's state is given.

Because of this state shape change, the selectors given to the `mapStateToProps` method must be changed to access the correct level of the state. For example, in the `VisibleTodoList` container.

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state: todosTypes.todosState) => {
  return {
    todos: todosSelectors.getVisibleTodos(
      state.todosState.todos,
      state.todosState.visibilityFilter
    )
  };
};
```
