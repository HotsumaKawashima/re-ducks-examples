# Re-ducks Examples
Example projects showing the translation from the standard redux folder structure to the [re-ducks](https://github.com/alexnm/re-ducks) modular approach.

The projects are direct translations from the redux examples found here <http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Examples.html> and here <https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples>.

Currently only the [Todos](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos) and [Todos-flow](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos-flow) projects have been implemented but should suffice as examples for beginners to re-ducks.

## Projects
*   [re-ducks-todos](https://github.com/jthegedus/re-ducks-examples/tree/master/re-ducks-todos)
*   [re-ducks-todos-flow](https://github.com/jthegedus/re-ducks-examples/tree/master/re-ducks-todos-flow)
